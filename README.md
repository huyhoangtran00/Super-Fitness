# Super-Fitness
 A fitness tracking app that supports running, cycling, trail running, hiking, and more. Built with Jetpack Compose for a modern and responsive UI. The app continues tracking in the background—even when the screen is off, the app is in the background — by leveraging Android’s foreground service. Location data is collected using Google Location Services and stored with Room for offline access. Includes a weather forecasting feature using the Meteo Weather API and Retrofit2, with day/night theming. Follows Clean Architecture principles. Planned updates include statistics visualization with charts and user account login for multi-device support.
